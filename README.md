I worked on this project while following Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path. During this project I: *Structured the page using HTML *Styled the page using CSS *Created a myEmojis array *Grabbed the emojiContainer div by using document.getElementById *Created a for loop for myEmojis array *Rendered the emojis as span tags in the emojisContainer div using createElement(), textContent, and append() *Added input field and button to add emojis *Added variables and event listener for the input field and button *Push the emoji into the myEmoji's array and clear the input field using if statement *Render the updated myEmojis array by wrapping the code for rendering the emojis in a function and make sure it clears away old version of the array before it renders the updated one *Add unshift button and have it add emojis to beginning *Add pop button and have it remove emojis from end *Add shift button and have it remove emojis from beginning
